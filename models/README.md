## Regeneration

```bash
make pull      # Download from HuggingFace
make convert   # Import to APR + export GGUF
```

## Tokenizers

Tokenizers are embedded within APR model files.
GGUF files use the tokenizer from the source APR model.
Original HuggingFace tokenizers are available via:

```bash
apr pull hf://HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M
apr pull hf://Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B
apr pull hf://openai-community/gpt2
```
